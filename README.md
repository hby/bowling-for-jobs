# Bowling for Jobs

A Clojure library that implements scoring in bowling.

## Why?

I had an interview where we worked through a problem in Ruby developing a scoring system for the game of bowling. I was quite disappointed in how I fumbled through it. Saying anything more would be too self-serving for my taste. My dissatifacion (and my desire to work as many Clojure problems as I can) drove me to implement it in Clojure while waiting for my flight home.

## Lesson?

I am naive. If I ever knew this was a popular problem I forgot it.

I really like test.check. A lot. This will part of how I do tests going forward.
