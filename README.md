# Bowling for Jobs

A Clojure library that implements scoring in bowling.

## Why ?

I had an interview where we worked through a problem in Ruby developing a scoring system for the game of bowling. I was quite disappointed in how I fumbled through it. Saying anything more would be too self-serving for my taste. My dissatifacion (and my desire to work as many Clojure problems as I can) drove me to implement it in Clojure while waiting for my flight home.

## Lessons ?

1. I am so ~~stupid~~ naive at times. While I know it now, if I ever knew this was a popular problem, I've long since forgot about it.
2. I really like [test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check). A lot. This will be a large part of how I do tests going forward.
3. And, yes, in most cases, I prefer to not have to deal with all those silly classes.
